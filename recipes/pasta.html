    <h1>Homemade Pasta</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade pasta dough is a fun and delicious way to step up your pasta
    game! With just 2 ingredients, spirit, and a lot of kneading you will be
    able to enjoy this dish that people have been making for hundreds of years.</p>
    <h2>ETA</h2>
    <p>Make: 60 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>2 Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour 1 to 2 cups of flour on counter and make a hole in the middle so
      it looks like a volcano.</li>
      <li>Crack 2 eggs and put them in the center of the "volcano."</li>
      <li>Using a fork, start whisking the eggs together while slowly adding
      picking up some flour each whisk.</li>
      <li>Once the eggs start to turn too solid to whisk with a for, begin
      kneading the mixture with your hands. (Make sure they are washed, of
      course!)</li>
      <li>After 5-15 minutes, a smooth dough will form, once this happens wrap
      the dough in plastic wrap and let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>After it is done sitting, cut the dough in half and roll each side
      until it is thin.</li>
      <li>cut small strands into each rolled dough and then bunch the strands
      together while tossing them in flour.</li>
      <li>From here you are finished! You can either freeze the dough for
      another day or cook it. If cooking the dough, remember, homemade pasta
      cooks much faster than store-bought pasta.</li>
    </ol>
