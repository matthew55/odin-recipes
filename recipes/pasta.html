    <h1>Homemade Pasta</h1>
    <p>Homemade pasta dough is a fun and delicious way to step up your pasta
    game! With just 2 ingredients, spirit, and a lot of kneading you will be
    able to enjoy this dish that people have been making for hundreds of years.</p>
    <h2>ETA</h2>
    <p>Total: 60 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>2 Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour 1 to 2 cups of flour onto a counter in a pile and make a hole in
      the middle of the pile so it looks like a volcano.</li>
      <li>Crack 2 eggs and put them in the center of the "volcano."</li>
      <li>Using a fork, start whisking the eggs together while slowly incorporating some flour each whisk.</li>
      <li>Once the eggs turn too solid to whisk, begin kneading the mixture with your hands. (Make sure they are washed, of course!)</li>
      <li>After 5-15 minutes, a smooth dough will form. Once this happens, wrap
      the dough in plastic wrap and let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>After it is done sitting, cut the dough in half and roll each half until thin.</li>
      <li>Cut the dough into 1/4 inch strands and toss the strands together with
      flour.</li>
      <li>From here you are finished! You can either freeze the dough for
      another day or cook it now. When cooking the dough remember, homemade pasta
      cooks much faster than store-bought pasta and the pasta water you cook the
      pasta in is full of flavor and starch that can be used for another dish.</li>
    </ol>
